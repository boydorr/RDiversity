\title{Similarity-sensitive normalised subcommunity alpha}
\usage{
normalised.subcommunity.alpha(super, qs)
}
\arguments{
\item{super}{object of class \code{supercommunity}}

\item{qs}{\code{vector} of \emph{q} values}
}
\value{
Returns a five-column \code{tibble}/\code{dataframe} containing:  
\code{partition} (label attributed to partition), \code{q} (parameter of 
conservatism), \code{diversity}, \code{community} (level of diversity, 
\emph{i.e.} subcommunity, community, or supercommunity), and \code{measure} 
(alpha, beta, rho, or gamma).
}
\description{
\code{normalised.subcommunity.alpha()} is used to calculate the 
similarity-sensitive diversity of subcommunity \emph{j} in isolation.
}
\details{
\code{normalised.subcommunity.alpha()} calculates the normalised subcommunity 
alpha diversity of a series of columns representing independent subcommunity 
counts relative to the supercommunity as a whole (by default the sum of the 
subcommunities). This measure may be calculated for a series of orders, 
repesented as a vector of \code{qs}.
}
\examples{
pop <- sample(1:50, 5)
super <- supercommunity(pop)

# Calculate normalised subcommunity alpha diversity
a <- normalised.alpha(super)
subdiv(a, 0:2)
normalised.subcommunity.alpha(super, 0:2)
